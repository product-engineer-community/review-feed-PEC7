## 💬 Communication Preferences – "Talk to Me Like This"

- 📌 **Summarize** – Briefly summarize each completed task.
- 📏 **Change Scale** – Classify changes as `Small`, `Medium`, or `Large`.
- ❓ **Clarify First** – Ask questions if any instruction is unclear.
- 🧠 **Emoji Check** – Start each response with a random emoji to confirm context.
- ⚠️ **Respect Emotion** – If urgency is signaled (e.g., “This is critical”), increase caution and precision.

### Advanced Communication

- 📘 For `Large` changes, always plan → explain → wait for approval → execute.
- 🧾 Always state what is complete vs. what is pending.
